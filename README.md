# High Performance Computing

I performed some experiments for testing various software acceleration techniques. These programs involve utilizing any one or a hybrid of the following methods:

- Algorithmic Optimization
- CPU acceleration (Multithreading, SIMD)
- GPU offloading (Compute Shaders)
- Distributed Computing (MPI)

These are written for educational purpose. You're free to use any code snippets from here.
